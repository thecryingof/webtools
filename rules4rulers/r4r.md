TAKE THE THRONE TO ACT, AND THE THRONE ACTS UPON YOU

## Dictatorships

  - no man rules alone **(1)**: get the key supporters on your side
  - in order to keep those keys to power, you must **(2)**: control the treasure
    - this is your true work as a ruler: figuring out how best to raise and distribute resources
    - balance the interests of your keys to power, big and small
    - thus, every bit spent on citizens is treasure not spent on loyalty
      - because keys have the same problem as you, just one level down
    - summarized: a king needs his court to raise treasure to keep the court loyal and keep raising the treasure
  - thus **(3)**: minimize key supporters
    - remember, the keys necessary to gain power are not the keys necessary to keep it

## Democracies

  - no man rules alone **(1)**: but don't think of citizens as individuals with their individual desires but instead as divided into blocks
  - control the treasure **(2)**: democracies are better places to live than dictatorships not because representatives are better people but because their needs happen to be aligned with a larger portion of the population (blocks)
    - and the treasure is split among more parts of a population (blocks)
    - and, as a result, healthy and educated population is more productive, thus, again, even with lower taxes, everybody gets their cut
  - minimize key supporters **(3)**: if a block doesn't vote, then no need to divert rewards their way
    - even if large in number, they are irrelevant to gaining power

## Revolts

  - in resource-rich dictatorships:
    - revolts are unlikely not because people are happy or scared but because starving and disconnected illiterates don't make good revolutionaries
  - in middling dictatorships without resources:
    - you must take a large amount of wealth directly from the citizens. thus, maintaining some minimums of life for the citizens. but keeping the work-force somewhat connected and somewhat educated and somewhat healthy makes them more able to revolt
      - however, the people usually storm the palace only when the army lets them. so, don't lose control over your keys (and don't educate your citizens)
  - on the other hand, democracies are stable:
    - because the large number of keys and their competing desires makes dictatorial revolt nearly impossible to organize
    - and also because the revolt would destroy the very wealth it intended to capture: the high productivity of the citizens
    - not to mention the probability for a key supporter to survive the coup:
      - either revolt succeeds and the supporter survives the further cull
      - or the supporter:
        - dies failing to survive the cull after the successive revolt 
        - dies during the non-successive revolt
        - goes to jail after the non-successive revolt
    - however, if a stable democracy becomes very poor, or if a resource that dwarfs the productivity of the citizens is found, the odds of this gamble change
      - because if the current quality of life is terrible or the wealth not dependent on the citizens, coups are worth the risk
